# Math Parser

## Overview
The Math Parser is a C program designed to tokenize and evaluate mathematical expressions. It can handle basic arithmetic operations and is implemented using the Shunting Yard algorithm for converting infix expressions to postfix notation.

## Features
- Tokenizes mathematical expressions
- Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Converts infix expressions to postfix notation
- Evaluates postfix expressions
- Dynamic memory management for arrays

## prerequisites:
 - gcc compiler/ visual stuido / code
